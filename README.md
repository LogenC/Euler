# Euler
Project Euler allows people to share their code up to the first 100 problems. Check out some general-purpose solutions here.

I see a lot of solutions that solve Euler problems very specifically, where inputting different parameters (than the ones asked by the question) would yield an incorrect result.

Altho responses are correct, it sort of defeats the purpose of creating a program.

Taking a different approach — an approach that others use too — here are more general-purpose solutions.

Breaking down each problem into sub-problems, I create functions that solve each sub-problem.

In the functional programming approach, I am able to input different variables and have a program that solves the essence of what the question is asking, not just with regards to the specific paramaters.
