#THE BRIEF
"""
Create a function that takes a number, finds its primes, and gives the largest one:

Because finding a prime is not a simple boolean expression, let's break the solution down into 2 fcns:
    Fcn 1: takes an integer and... returns TRUE if int is prime, returns FALSE if not
    Fcn 2: takes an integer â€” preferably a big number â€” and finds its largest prime
"""


# fcn 'is_prime' determines if an int is prime
#note: we test only up to the sqrt of the integer test_num. WHY is only up to the square root sufficient?
#   math answer: if a >= b and a * b = x, and sqrt(x) * sqrt (x) = x, then a >= sqrt(x) and b <= sqrt(x)
#   in english: if x is divisible by anything up to it's square root, by definition, it can't be prime
#               hence, because b <= a and a * b = x , and b could equal sqrt(x), by the time you test divisibility
#               up to sqrt(x) (b's highest potential value), if nothing is divisible, the number has to be prime

#THE DEBRIEF
"""
Many solutions floating around on the interwebs do not account for testing even numbers and leave out logic from the 
first part of the if statement in the largest_prime_factor fcn

To have the most encompassing, or general, solution, one must account for as many possibilities as are relevant.
